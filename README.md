# TidyTuesday

#TidyTuesday is a weekly data project that focuses on practicing data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling skills using real-world datasets. The initiative, organized by the R community and supported by the R4DS (R for Data Science) Online Learning Community, encourages participants to explore open datasets, create visualizations, and share their insights with the community. While R and the tidyverse packages (like dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyr) are commonly used, participants can use any tools they prefer.The project emphasizes the process of exploration and learning rather than creating the "perfect" chart or analysis.
